    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gumbo is a delicious chicken and sausage stew.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small green bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>2 ribs celery, diced</li>
        <li>1 small white onion, diced</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take 1 small green bell pepper, 2 ribs of celery, and 1 small white onion (also known as the “holy trinity”)
            and dice them into medium-sized pieces. Set aside for later. </li>
        <li>Mince 6 garlic cloves and set aside for later.</li>
        <li>For the roux, add ½ cup of vegetable oil to a pot and allow it to get smoking hot before adding ½ cup of all
            purpose flour. Using a wooden spoon or preferably a whisk, mix together until the consistency is similar to
            wet sand. </li>
        <li>Within 30 seconds, the roux should be the color of milk chocolate. The darker the roux gets, the more you
            need to stir it, but let it sit for a few seconds before continuing to stir. After about 5-6 minutes, the
            color of the roux should be nice and dark or similar to the color of a Hershey's chocolate bar. Set aside
            some of the roux to use later.</li>
    </ol>
