    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Authentic New Orleans Gumbo is made with a dark roux, vegetables, chicken, sausage, and shrimp, and served
        over rice. This is a beloved recipe shared with me by a native New Orleanian.

        As you probably have gathered, I love making comfort food style recipes that use lots of fresh produce and real
        ingredients. This gumbo is no exception, and if you like this then I know you'll love Jambalaya and Instant Pot
        Red Beans and Rice.

        We had a really fun neighbor growing up who was from New Orleans and made a fantastic homemade Gumbo! I'm so
        thankful my Mom took him up on his offer to teach her how to make a true, authentic Gumbo! Decades later it is a
        beloved recipe that has become a staple in our family and we have made it hundreds of times! It is definitely in
        my top favorite meals of all time! Nothing tastes better on a cold winter day.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small green bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>2 ribs celery, diced</li>
        <li>1 small white onion, diced</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>8 ounces beer (just not a light beer!)</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 lb andouille sausage, cut into coins (or smoked kielbasa)</li>
        <li>1 lb boneless, skinless, chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>Cooked white rice, for serving</li>
        <li>Sliced scallions, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take 1 small green bell pepper, 2 ribs of celery, and 1 small white onion (also known as the “holy trinity”)
            and dice them into medium-sized pieces. Set aside for later. </li>
        <li>Mince 6 garlic cloves and set aside for later.</li>
        <li>For the roux, add ½ cup of vegetable oil to a pot and allow it to get smoking hot before adding ½ cup of all
            purpose flour. Using a wooden spoon or preferably a whisk, mix together until the consistency is similar to
            wet sand. </li>
        <li>Within 30 seconds, the roux should be the color of milk chocolate. The darker the roux gets, the more you
            need to stir it, but let it sit for a few seconds before continuing to stir. After about 5-6 minutes, the
            color of the roux should be nice and dark or similar to the color of a Hershey's chocolate bar. Set aside
            some of the roux to use later.</li>
        <li>Add 2 bay leaves as well as your “holy trinity” to the pot. Make sure to set aside some of the holy trinity
            mix for later. </li>
        <li>Once the mixture calms down a bit, add the minced garlic to the pot. Let the roux sit for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add 8 ounces of beer and stir it in and whisk to prevent the mixture from becoming clumpy. Then, add 4 cups
            of chicken stock and whisk using the same procedure as the beer.</li>
        <li>Take 1 lb of andouille sausage or smoked kielbasa and cut into coins.</li>
        <li>Add kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to both sides of 1 lb of boneless, skinless chicken thighs.
            Sear the chicken thighs in a smoking hot pan with oil. </li>
        <li>Add 1 tbsp of cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt to the roux.</li>
        <li>Turn the stovetop temperature to the lowest simmer possible and add a generous amount of black pepper to the
            roux. Then, add 1 tbsp of smoked paprika and stir. </li>
        <li>After browning the chicken, add it straight to the pot and set aside the remaining oil from the chicken.
            Next, add the chopped up sausage or smoked kielbasa to the pot.</li>
        <li>Bring the roux to a bare simmer, cover it, and let sit for a couple of hours.</li>
        <li>Serve with cooked white rice, garnish with scallions, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
